## ID bias in text

This data includes around 874 MB of text "comment" data stored in json format

Data is found here:https://figshare.com/articles/data_json/7376747
Collection of user-generated online news comments published from 2015-2017 as part of a now-defunct commenting platform. For use in furthering research into online toxicity, bias, and harassment.



MVP: I would like to focus on the concept of identifing bias text focusing first in this commenting platform with the hopes of encorporating news headline data

MVP+ Once identifying bias words or phrases, I would like to create a "recommender" to make a suggestion of how to "unbias" the text

MVP++ It would be great to also identify the possibility of repeating the process with "harassment or violent" comments as well
