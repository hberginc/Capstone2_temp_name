## ID bias in text
I have been looking through this data found via 'The Big Bad NLP Database' and have really found interest in identifying bias text with the hopes of eventually creating "unbiased" suggestions.
Data is organized in various formats here: https://github.com/rpryzant/neutralizing-bias
It looks like there is 180,000 instances available contianing biased and neutralzied versions of text from wikipedia. I am also interested in utilizing more wikipedia entries to create unbaiased versions if possible.
